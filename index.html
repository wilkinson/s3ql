    <h1>S3QL</h1>

<p>This project will implement the
<a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/12/285/">S3QL</a> API for the
<a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> platform. The prototype will use
<a href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a> for data storage initially, although
<a href="http://www.sqlite.org/">SQLite</a> will also be targeted in the future. All
program logic for the governance model will be written in pure JavaScript. The
implementation will be embeddable into existing applications either as a
<a href="https://npmjs.org/package/s3ql">Node.js module</a> or as a standalone program
completely accessible over HTTP via the S3QL API.</p>

<p>Please note that the project, in its current state, is a work-in-progress port
from a <a href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a> project called <a href="http://s3db.org">S3DB</a>, and
we do not yet recommend this port for use in production systems. This project&#39;s
goal is to &quot;gut&quot; S3DB and keep only its core model as a means to add a
governance layer to any arbitrary database. A number of wonderful database
projects have emerged in the last few years, but this project is not a database
-- it is an implementation of an API which seamlessly abstracts database calls
as governed by a formal mathematical model.</p>

<p>Get in touch if you&#39;re interesting in helping -- I have a wishlist with tasks
suitable for all skill levels :-)</p>
